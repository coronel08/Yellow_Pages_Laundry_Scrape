# Yellow_Pages_Laundry_Scrape
A very poorly written webscraper that scrapes YellowPages and exports info to CSV.
Script was created so I can create a mailing list of local businesses without having to look up businesses individually. 

Uses just requests, urllib, and lxml library. 

Contact me at coronel08@aol.com for any questions or suggestions.
